The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations with different units. However, there might be unexpected behavior when using `calc()` with percentages, particularly when dealing with nested elements or complex layouts.  For example, if you calculate a width using a percentage within a parent element that has its own percentage width, the result might not be what you expect. The browser needs to resolve these percentages sequentially, possibly leading to unexpected rendering or layout shifts.   Another common mistake is incorrect operator precedence or missing parentheses, which can lead to errors in calculation.
